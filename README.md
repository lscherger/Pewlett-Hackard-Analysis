# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
employee database analysis

## Overview of Project

### Background
Bobby, an employee at Pewlett-Hackard, requested an analysis of the company's growing retirement-ready population with the help of SQL scripts in PostGressql using PGAdmin4 to deliver to his manager, who wants to understand how the growing number of retirement-ready employees (the 'silver tsunami') will affect their business. The deliverables for this project included a count of retiring employees based on title, and a list of employees who are now eligible for mentorship programs. 

### Purpose
As an introduction to SQL, the purpose of this project was to utilize queries in PGAdmin4 with PostGressql to create and analyze an employee database. Since the raw data included multiple csvs that housed employee and department data, the analysis required table JOINs and multiple csv import/exports in PgAdmin4. 


## Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* Result 1:
* Result 2:
* Result 3:
* Result 4:


## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami.":
