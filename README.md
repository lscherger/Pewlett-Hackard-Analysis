# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
employee database analysis

## Overview of Project

### Background
Maria, a member of the PyCitySchools district board, requested an analysis of the district's math and reading scores this year with the help of Python in Jupyter Notebooks. The deliverables for this project included an analysis of scores based on several factors including school, school spending per student, school size, school type and grade level. Additionally, due to evidence of academic dishonesty of 9th graders at Thomas High School, the script needed to re-run the audit with those scores removed to compare the score summaries. 

### Purpose
As an introduction to Jupyter Notebook, the purpose of this project was to utilize Pandas DataFrames with Python to complete the analysis. Since the script needed to be refactored, it gave extra opportunity to practice using Pandas DataFrames, such as loc, merge and groupby, to wrangle data. 


## Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami.":
